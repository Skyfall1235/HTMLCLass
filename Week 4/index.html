    <h1>Hog Dice Game</h1>
    <p>Instructions: The goal of Hog Dice is to score the most points. On each turn, a player rolls a specified number of dice. The sum of the dice is added to their score. However, if a 1 is rolled, the player's turn ends and they lose their accumulated points for that turn. If two 1s are rolled, the player's score is halved.</p>
